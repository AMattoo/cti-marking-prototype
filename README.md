## <a id="readme-general">OASIS Open Repository: cti-marking-prototype</a>

This GitHub public repository ( **[https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-marking-prototype](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-marking-prototype)** ) was created at the request of the [OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cti/) as an [OASIS Open Repository](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/) to support development of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.

While this Open Repository remains associated with the sponsor TC, its development priorities, leadership, intellectual property terms, participation rules, and other matters of governance are [separate and distinct](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-marking-prototype/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#governance-distinct-from-oasis-tc-process) from the OASIS TC Process and related policies.

All contributions made to this Open Repository are subject to open source license terms expressed in the [BSD-3-Clause License](https://www.oasis-open.org/sites/www.oasis-open.org/files/BSD-3-Clause.txt). That license was selected as the declared ["Applicable License"](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses) when the Open Repository was created.

As documented in ["Public Participation Invited](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-marking-prototype/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#public-participation-invited)", contributions to this OASIS Open Repository are invited from all parties, whether affiliated with OASIS or not. Participants must have a GitHub account, but no fees or OASIS membership obligations are required. Participation is expected to be consistent with the [OASIS Open Repository Guidelines and Procedures](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-repositories), the open source [LICENSE](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-marking-prototype/blob/master/LICENSE) designated for this particular repository, and the requirement for an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/cla/individual-cla) that governs intellectual property.

## <a id="purposeStatement">Statement of Purpose</a>

Statement of Purpose for this OASIS Open Repository (cti-marking-prototype) as [proposed](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/cti/201609/msg00001.html) and [approved](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ballot.php?id=2971) [[bis](https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/TCADMIN-2432)] by the TC:

The marking-prototype is a prototype implementation of granular data markings in STIX. It provides a potential API that can be used to create and process the markings, in order to examine the utility, usability, and completeness of how the granular data markings are specified. After the markings are added to the STIX specification, the code in this library may be used as reference, or incorporated directly into other libraries, but is not intended to be released as a standalone tool or library.

## About

Supports both object markings and granular markings.

## Requirements

 * Python 2.7.6+ or Python 3.5.0+
 * six 1.10.0
